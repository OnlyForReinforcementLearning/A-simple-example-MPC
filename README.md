# A-simple-example-MPC
Use 'fmincon' and 'quadprog' to simulate MPC 

There are two different programs to show the MPC for tracking control for a linear system, and it is very suitable for new beginner who wants to learn MPC.

'MPC_QP' shows MPC for a linear system by using 'quadprog', and 'MPC_fmincon' shows MPC for a linear system by using 'fmincon'.

Note that the model constraint doesn't contain in the 'quadprog' or 'fmincon'.

Hope these two matlab programs can help you!
